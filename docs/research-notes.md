# Acoustic Ray Tracing Research Notes

## Current Implementation

Our current implementation uses a basic ray tracing approach with:
- Random ray direction sampling
- Surface-specific absorption coefficients
- Energy decay based on distance and material properties
- WebGPU for parallel ray computation

## Research-Based Improvements

### 1. Hybrid Method (Ray Tracing + Image Source)
Based on [Aussal & Gueguen, 2018], we should implement:
- Image source method for early reflections (more accurate)
- Ray tracing for late reflections (more efficient)
- Combine both for full impulse response

### 2. Performance Optimizations
#### Spatial Data Structures
- Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree for room geometry
- Reduces intersection test complexity from O(n) to O(log n)
- Particularly important for complex room geometries

#### GPU Optimizations
- Use compute shaders for parallel ray processing
- Implement work group optimization
- Buffer management for efficient data transfer

### 3. Physical Accuracy

#### Frequency-Dependent Materials
- Absorption coefficients per frequency band:
  - 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz
- Scattering coefficients for diffuse reflections
- Phase changes at boundaries

#### Environmental Factors
- Air absorption based on:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Atmospheric pressure
- Doppler effect for moving sources/listeners

### 4. Sound Propagation

#### Energy Calculations
- Improved distance-based decay:
  ```
  E = E0 * exp(-m*d) * (1-α)
  where:
  - E0: initial energy
  - m: air absorption coefficient
  - d: distance traveled
  - α: surface absorption coefficient
  ```

#### Directivity
- Sound source directivity patterns
- Frequency-dependent radiation patterns
- Receiver (listener) directivity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Improvements
1. Implement BSP tree for room geometry
2. Add frequency-dependent material properties
3. Improve energy calculations with air absorption

### Phase 2: Hybrid Method
1. Implement image source method for early reflections
2. Combine with existing ray tracing
3. Create smooth transition between methods

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add scattering/diffusion
2. Implement source/receiver directivity
3. Add environmental factors

## Notes on WebGPU Implementation

### Compute Shader Optimizations
```wgsl
// Improved work group size for better GPU utilization
@compute @workgroup_size(256)
fn main(@builtin(global_invocation_id) global_id: vec3u) {
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

### Buffer Management
- Use storage buffers for large datasets
- Uniform buffers for frequently accessed data
- Double buffering for async updates

### Future Considerations
- Real-time auralization
- VR/AR integration
- Dynamic room geometry updates
- Multi-listener support
